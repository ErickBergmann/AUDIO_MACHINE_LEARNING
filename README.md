# Introduction to Applied Machine Learning for Audio: Theory and Implementation

![](img/dall_e_image.png)

The contents of the course "Introduction to Applied Machine Learning for Audio: Theory and Implementation" are designed to convey concepts and understand classical machine learning methods with the goal of training models in a supervised or unsupervised manner, capable of classifying different types of audio, whether into single or multiple labels. Besides, we visited some public generative models using recurrent neural networks and LSTMs. The course is largely a compilation of information scattered across the internet, which has been translated into Spanish, with an emphasis on some demonstrations and mathematical tools inherent to the models, along with notebooks and examples oriented towards audio-related problems.
The lecture is tailored for Sound Engineering students at the University of Chile. 

Upon completing the course, the student will:

- Understand general ideas about the use and operation of different machine learning models.

- Understand different mathematical perspectives of these models, associating different mathematical tools as part of the different models.

- Recognize and use preprocessing strategies for audio handling.

- Apply these models to audio classification problems by using various strategies and comparing results using different statistical tools and data visualization techniques.
